DoDo - Task Management for Hackers
----------------------------------

Dodo is an easily maintainable task list for version controlled projects and hackers. We can call `dodo`  a ticket tracking inside the repo itself.
Tasks are called as *DoDo*, and __your goal is to make DoDos extinct.__

In the latest version, username is automatically populated from the system username if not passed explicitly. And the usage flow has been stripped down so as to take the ease of use to the next level

pip install dodopie
